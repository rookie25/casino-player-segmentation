2. Calculate Frequency (F)
   - Number of betting days
   - More frequent = higher score
   - Scale from 1-5

3. Calculate Monetary (M)
   - Total amount wagered
   - Higher spending = higher score
   - Scale from 1-5

4. Combine RFM scores
   - Create composite RFM score
   - Use for clustering

5. Run K-means clustering algorithm
   - Test 3-6 clusters
   - Use elbow method to find optimal number
   - Assign each player to a segment

6. Profile each segment
   - Calculate average RFM scores
   - Calculate average betting metrics
   - Determine segment sizes
   - Identify characteristics

7. Name the segments meaningfully
   Examples:
   - "VIP High Rollers" (high R, high F, high M)
   - "Regular Players" (medium across all)
   - "Casual Gamblers" (low F, low M)
   - "At-Risk Players" (low R, was high F/M)

WHAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY IN INTERVIEWS
=========================================

"I wanted to demonstrate my understanding of casino analytics, so I built a player segmentation model using real data from Harvard's Transparency Project.

I analyzed over 4,000 casino players across 2 years, applying RFM analysis to segment them into 5 distinct groups based on their betting behavior. I then calculated Customer Lifetime Value for each segment to identify the most profitable player types.

My key finding was [you'll discover this from your analysis - for example: 'that 15% of players (VIP segment) generated 60% of total value, but were receiving disproportionately low marketing attention'].

I built a Power BI dashboard that visualizes these segments and provides recommendations for optimal reinvestment levels. For example, I found that spending $X on high-value players has a Y% ROI compared to only Z% for casual players.

This approach is directly applicable to Caesars' omnichannel strategy, especially considering how online and offline behavior could be combined for even more accurate segmentation. I'm excited to apply these analytical skills to help optimize player retention and marketing efficiency.

Here's my dashboard and all the code is on my GitHub if you'd like to see the technical details."
