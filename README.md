# Casino Player Segmentation Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview
Comprehensive casino player segmentation analysis using RFM methodology, K-means clustering, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction to optimize player retention strategies and marketing ROI.

## 📊 Data Source
- **Dataset:** Harvard Transparency Project - Virtual Casino Gambling
- **Sample Size:** 4,000+ players
- **Time Period:** 2 years
- **Source:** [Harvard Division on Addiction](http://www.thetransparencyproject.org/)

## 🔍 Business Problem
Casino operators need to identify high-value player segments and optimize marketing spend allocation. This analysis provides data-driven insights for:
- Player segmentation and profiling
- Lifetime value prediction
- Retention strategy optimization
- Marketing budget allocation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x** - Data analysis and modeling
- **pandas, NumPy** - Data manipulation
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning (K-means clustering)
- **matplotlib, seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Power BI** - Interactive dashboard
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Analysis environment

## 📈 Methodology
1. **RFM Analysis** - Segmented players based on:
   - Recency: Days since last bet
   - Frequency: Number of betting sessions
   - Monetary: Total amount wagered

2. **K-Means Clustering** - Identified 5 distinct player segments

3. **CLV Prediction** - Calculated Customer Lifetime Value using historical patterns

4. **Business Recommendations** - Developed optimal reinvestment strategies
