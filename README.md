# Casino Player Segmentation Analysis

**Data-driven player segmentation using RFM analysis and K-means clustering to maximize marketing ROI and player lifetime value**

---

## üìä Overview

This project segments **4,222 online casino players** into 5 distinct behavioral groups using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and unsupervised machine learning. The segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies, optimal budget allocation, and identifies high-value players requiring retention focus. The analysis delivers actionable business recommendations with a projected **3x marketing ROI**.

## üíº Business Problem

Casino operators struggle with:
- **Inefficient marketing spend** - treating all players the same
- **VIP churn risk** - losing high-value players to competitors  
- **Low conversion rates** - failing to nurture casual players into regulars
- **Resource waste** - investing in dormant, low-value segments

**Solution:** Segment players by behavior patterns and develop targeted strategies for each group, maximizing ROI and player lifetime value.

## üìÅ Dataset

**Source:** Harvard Dataverse - Online Casino Dataset  
**Scope:** 4,222 players tracked over 2 years (Feb 2005 - Feb 2007)  
**Variables:** 20 features including betting patterns, frequency, and monetary value

**Key Metrics:**
- **Recency:** Days since last bet (0-752 days)
- **Frequency:** Total active days (4-524 days)  
- **Monetary:** Total stakes wagered ($0.12 - $3.4M)

---

## üî¨ Methodology

**Phase 1: RFM Analysis**
- Calculated Recency, Frequency, Monetary scores for each player
- Normalized all scores to 0-100 scale for equal weighting

**Phase 2: K-Means Clustering**
- Applied Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
- Selected K=5 as optimal segmentation
- Assigned all 4,222 players to segments

**Phase 3: Business Strategy**
- Profiled each segment behaviorally
- Developed targeted marketing strategies
- Allocated $1M annual budget across segments
- Projected ROI and created 90-day implementation roadmap

### Key Business Insights:

**1. The Pareto Principle in Action**  
- Only 2.9% of players (123 VIPs) drive disproportionate revenue
- VIP retention is mission-critical - even 1 VIP lost = massive revenue impact
- Justifies 40% budget allocation to <3% of player base

**2. Massive Growth Opportunity**  
- 30.7% of players are new/casual with low current LTV
- Proper nurturing and conversion programs could significantly increase revenue
- 15-25% conversion rate would add substantial value

**3. Resource Optimization**  
- 43.7% of players (dormant + inactive) contribute minimal value
- Should receive only 15% of budget (automated campaigns)
- Frees resources for high-potential segments
